                Drinking water, or hydration, helps our body's temperature regulation and digestion. Proper hydration encourages heathier lifestyles and prevents diseases. Not drinking enough water leads to dehydration, which is an issue often overlooked, but if we spread awareness about it, we can improve people's well-being and contribute to better public health.
