                A person is dehydrated when their body loses more water than it ingests. Mild dehydration can cause fatigue and headaches. Meanwhile, severe dehydration may lead to dizziness, high blood pressure, and serious health complications. People in hot and arid climates, athletes, children, and the elderly are the most susceptible. To prevent this, we should drink enough clean water everyday.</p>
